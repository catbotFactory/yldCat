## Before starting

We will use the [firmata][1] protocol to talk with the microcontroller.

Firmata is a protocol based on midi that provide an "API" to control your MCU hardware.

In the examples and exercices that you will find here, we will use Javascript, nodejs, and the [Johnny-Five][2] package

You will need [nodejs][3] (somehow recent) to use the test tool and the workshoper 

## Test firmata on the board

the board should be flashed with firmata but let's try anyway

in a terminal and in your project directory

```
git clone git@github.com:catbotFactory/yldWorkshop.git
cd yldWorkshop
npm install
npm run firmTest
```

firmTest should say something like 
```
your board is ready to use !
```
and exit.

If not go [here][4] and come back

## test the catbot, Calibrating and config file creation

```
npm run cat
```

Will ask you a few question and help you calibrate your catbot.  
Once done it will write a ```~/.catbotrc``` file that will be loaded by the catbot lib, allowing you simple override of the default options, if you have an analog joystick you can enable it in this file.
