To assemble the frame of the catbot you will need

- all wodden bits from the kit
- the 2 servomotors (the 2 blue ones)
- the laser

## Notes before assembling

parts for this kits are made to snap and fit together without glue, so you will sometime need to force push part together, to do so, apply presure progessibely vertically on pre aligned parts. 

## Step by step instructions

We start with the top part, take a servo and the top part align servo gear with the top notch of the wooden bit

Place this wooden bit on the top of the servo

    same thing with the bottom part (this one have space for passing the wire)

    Place the 'E' shaped bit in the top notches

    Now place the top part on the circular base

    these two bit will hold the turret in place, you may need to force a bit to make these one s fit in.

    now we make the laser holder, you should have the wooden bit on the opposite side of the plastic gear

    insert the laser (the dark grey cylinder in the pict in the wooden bit

    top part is now complete

    Now we will start the base

    use the one with the engraved logos logo side facing outside
![img caption](imgs/21.png)
![img caption](imgs/22.png)
    take care that the notches from the two part matches sides
![img caption](imgs/23.png)
![img caption](imgs/24.png)
    now place the servo, servo gear should be centered, if not turn both bar sides
![img caption](imgs/25.png)
![img caption](imgs/26.png)
![img caption](imgs/27.png)
![img caption](imgs/28.png)
    the two bits are here to reinforce structure, so you need to slightly bend the two outer bar inward, and will need more force to set them in postition

    now put the top part on the base sevo, gear, and you are done !!! ta da !

you will have some leftover bit, some plastic horn for the servo motors, and some screws.

screws can be used later on, when the catbot is calibrated to keep the servo and the turret in place, to do so use a small screwdriver to screw them un the middle of the servo gear through the horn
